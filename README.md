# Task Manager (Simple Web App)

This is a minimal, single-page Task Management (To‑Do) web app that:
- Add, edit (inline), delete tasks
- Mark tasks complete / active
- Search & filter tasks
- Data persisted to `localStorage`

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (no server required).
2. Add tasks, edit by clicking title, mark complete with checkbox.
3. Data is persisted in your browser's localStorage.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — styles
- `app.js` — app logic (localStorage)
- `README.md` — this file

Made for quick demos and as a starter project.
